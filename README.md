# To me, design needs to give people an experience that also solves a problem.

I want to create something that is entertaining. Making people engaged in the design. Wanting them to explore it, but also being easy to understand, and user-friendly.

I like Jesse Schell’s opinion on this topic:

> **“Design is a process that focuses on creating enjoyable experiences by understanding what users want and needs.”**

Balancing creativity with practical solutions is the most important thing to him and to me as well. Design also needs character to stand out in today's world. It helps connect users with the design, making it memorable.
