## My Design Philosophy

# To me, Design creates an experience that also solves a problem.

I want to create something that is entertaining. Making people engaged in the design. Wanting them to explore it, but also being easy to understand, and user-friendly.

I like Jesse Schell’s opinion on this topic:

> **“Design is a process that focuses on creating enjoyable experiences by understanding what users want and needs.”**

Balancing creativity with practical solutions is the most important thing to him and to me as well. Design also needs character to stand out in today's world. Character helps connect people with the design through their experience, making it memorable.
