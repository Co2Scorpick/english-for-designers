# Welcome

My name is Ondřej Mišák, 

## About me

Curretly writing my bachelor's at School of Creative Communication. I decided to pursue Design, because I love creating meaningful stuff. To me, design needs to give people an experience that also solves a problem.

I want to create something that is entertaining. Making people engaged in the design. Wanting them to explore it, but also being easy to understand, and user-friendly. I mainly focus on UX/UI Design, but I don't mind doing other designer work as well.
